Airdrop is a small utility program built to make the most tedious aspect of initial token distribution (Commonly known as airdropping) easier â€” The calculation aspect of it. Airdrop will automatically fetch all trustlines set against the desired currency so it can then calculate the total yield per trustline token, which is then finally filtered and organized into a table for you to use as the total distribution table for the distribution itself.\n\n"
